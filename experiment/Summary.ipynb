    "Over the course of all the EvoCNN expriments run, it was found that the average classification accuracy increased and the standard deviation decreased over the course of all the generations. Therefore, evolution was successful in its mission of evolving more robust networks over time with increased generations and epochs.\n",

In addition, we found that network structures with 3 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers performed best with ReLU over the generations consistently. \n",
